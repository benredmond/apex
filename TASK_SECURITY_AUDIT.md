# Security Audit: Review Command Execution Patterns

## Context
Follow-up task created from TbzXveKStGxs7f3pGpaMZX security vulnerability fix.
Critical security issue discovered in RepoIdentifier demonstrates need for comprehensive audit.

## Problem Statement
Command injection vulnerability found in RepoIdentifier suggests other locations may have similar security issues. Need systematic review of all external command execution in codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Audit all spawn() and exec() usage across entire codebase
- [ ] Verify consistent input sanitization patterns are applied
- [ ] Document any additional vulnerabilities found
- [ ] Apply PAT:SECURITY:INPUT_SANITIZATION pattern where needed
- [ ] Create security testing suite for command execution
- [ ] Update security guidelines for future development

## Scope
- Review all files using child_process module
- Check for direct user input to command execution
- Validate input sanitization completeness
- Ensure shell: false is used appropriately
- Review argument construction patterns

## Security Focus Areas
1. **Input Validation**: All user input must be validated before command execution
2. **Sanitization**: Remove or escape dangerous characters
3. **Whitelist Approach**: Only allow known-safe characters and patterns
4. **Directory Traversal**: Block .. and absolute path attempts
5. **Shell Execution**: Never use shell: true with user input

## Expected Deliverables
- Security audit report with findings
- Updated code with consistent security patterns
- Security testing suite
- Documentation updates for secure development practices

## Estimated Effort
3 hours
