## Contributing Patterns

APEX thrives on community-contributed patterns. To contribute a pattern:

### 1. Document the Pattern

Add to `src/templates/CONVENTIONS.pending.md`:

```markdown
[TYPE:CATEGORY:SPECIFIC] â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜† (0 uses, 0% success) @tags
```code
// Your pattern code here
```
CONTEXT: When to use this pattern
PREVENTS: What errors/issues this prevents
SEE_ALSO: [RELATED:PATTERN:ID]
```

### 2. Pattern Types

- **CMD**: Command patterns (build, test, run commands)
- **PAT**: Code patterns (implementation patterns)
- **FIX**: Fix patterns (error â†’ solution mappings)
- **ARCH**: Architecture patterns (design decisions)

### 3. Testing Patterns

Before submitting, test your pattern:
1. Use it in at least 3 different scenarios
2. Document success rate
3. Note any edge cases or failures
