# Pattern Discovery Improvements

## Summary

Enhanced the APEX MCP pattern discovery system to be more intuitive and effective for AI assistants.

## Changes Made

### 1. Improved MCP Tool Descriptions
- Added clear, action-oriented descriptions for the `apex_patterns_lookup` tool
- Included concrete examples in parameter descriptions (e.g., "fix sqlite sync error", "implement user authentication")
- Clarified pattern ID format with examples like `FIX:SQLITE:SYNC` and `CODE:API:FASTAPI_ENDPOINT`

### 2. Unified Pattern Storage
- Consolidated pattern storage into a single `patterns` table
- Removed the separate draft/production distinction
- All patterns now start with initial trust score of 0.5 (Beta(1,1))
- Trust scores increase based on successful usage

### 3. Direct Pattern Insertion
- Modified reflection service to insert patterns directly into the main table
- Created `PatternInserter` class to handle pattern creation with proper initialization
- Patterns are immediately discoverable after reflection

### 4. Inclusive Pattern Lookup
- Removed trust score filtering from queries
- All patterns are now returned, ordered by trust score
- Allows new patterns to be discovered and tested
- High-trust patterns naturally appear first

### 5. Database Schema Updates
- Added `alpha`, `beta`, `usage_count`, `success_count`, and `status` columns to patterns table
- Created `pattern_snippets` table for code examples
- Added proper indices for performance

## Benefits

1. **Better Discoverability**: AI assistants can now find all patterns, not just high-trust ones
2. **Simpler Architecture**: Single table with trust scores is easier to understand and maintain
3. **Immediate Availability**: Patterns are available for use immediately after creation
4. **Natural Evolution**: Patterns gain trust through successful usage over time

## Testing

Created test scripts to verify:
- Pattern insertion from reflections
- Pattern lookup by keyword
- Trust score ordering

## Next Steps

1. Implement automatic trust score updates based on usage feedback
2. Add pattern usage tracking and analytics
3. Create pattern promotion workflows for high-performing patterns
4. Add MCP prompts/resources for complex workflows
