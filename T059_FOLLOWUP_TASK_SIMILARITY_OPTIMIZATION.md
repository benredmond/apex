# Follow-up: Task Similarity Background Precomputation

## Context
This task addresses performance optimization opportunities identified in T058_APE-54:
- The `precomputeSimilarities()` method was implemented but not integrated
- Background processing could improve user experience for similarity searches
- Cache warming for active tasks would reduce query latency

## Problem Statement
While the similarity search achieves 4ms performance (exceeding the 50ms requirement), the first query for any task requires full computation. Active tasks could benefit from proactive similarity calculation to provide instant results.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement background task to precompute similarities for active tasks
- [ ] Schedule precomputation to run every 30 minutes for active tasks
- [ ] Ensure precomputation doesn't interfere with normal operations
- [ ] Monitor cache hit rate improvement (target: >90% for active tasks)
- [ ] Add metrics tracking for precomputation effectiveness

## Technical Approach
1. Create background scheduler service
2. Integrate with existing `precomputeSimilarities()` method  
3. Add configuration for precomputation intervals
4. Implement proper error handling for background operations
5. Add performance metrics collection

## Dependencies
- T058_APE-54 must be completed (similarity search implementation)
- Task repository status queries must be available

## Estimated Effort
- 4 hours (complexity rating: 4/10)
- Low risk - enhancement to existing working system

## Success Metrics
- Cache hit rate >90% for active task similarity queries
- Background processing completes within 10 seconds for 50 active tasks
- Zero impact on foreground query performance
