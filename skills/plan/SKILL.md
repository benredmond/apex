<skill name="apex:plan" phase="plan">

<overview>
Transform research findings into battle-tested implementation plans through interactive design.

Produces 5 mandatory artifacts: Chain of Thought, Tree of Thought, Chain of Draft, YAGNI Declaration, Pattern Selection.
</overview>

<phase-gate requires="research" sets="plan">
  <reads-file>./.apex/tasks/[ID].md</reads-file>
  <requires-section>research</requires-section>
  <appends-section>plan</appends-section>
</phase-gate>

<principles>
- **Be Skeptical**: Question vague requirements, identify issues early, verify with code
- **Be Interactive**: Get buy-in at each step, don't create full plan in one shot
- **Be Thorough**: Read ALL files FULLY, research patterns with parallel agents
- **Be Evidence-Based**: Every decision backed by code, patterns, or research
- **No Open Questions**: STOP and clarify before proceeding with unknowns
</principles>

<initial-response>
<if-no-arguments>
I'll create a rigorous technical architecture. Please provide the task identifier.

You can find active tasks in `./.apex/tasks/` or run with:
`/apex:plan [identifier]`
</if-no-arguments>
<if-arguments>Load task file and begin architecture process.</if-arguments>
</initial-response>

<workflow>

<step id="1" title="Load task and verify phase">
<instructions>
1. Read `./.apex/tasks/[identifier].md`
2. Verify frontmatter `phase: research`
3. Parse `<research>` section for context
4. If phase != research, refuse with: "Task is in [phase] phase. Expected: research"
5. Extract context pack references from `<context-pack-refs>`:
   - ctx.patterns = research.apex-patterns
   - ctx.impl = research.codebase-patterns
   - ctx.web = research.web-research
   - ctx.history = research.git-history
   - ctx.docs = research.documentation
   - ctx.risks = research.risks
   - ctx.exec = research.recommendations.winner

Based on research and analysis, I understand we need to [accurate summary].

**Key Findings:**
- [Current implementation at file:line]
- [Pattern discovered with trust score]
- [Complexity identified]

**Questions Requiring Human Judgment:**
- [Design preference that affects architecture]
- [Business logic clarification]
- [Risk tolerance decision]

Let's address these before I develop architecture options.

<step id="4" title="Propose architecture structure">
<template>
Here's my proposed architecture approach:

## Core Components:
1. [Component A] - [purpose]
2. [Component B] - [purpose]
3. [Component C] - [purpose]

## Implementation Phases:
1. [Phase name] - [what it delivers]
2. [Phase name] - [what it delivers]

Does this structure align with your vision? Should I adjust?

YOU CANNOT FABRICATE PATTERNS.

Only use patterns that exist in:

- ctx.impl (from research.codebase-patterns)

Before listing a pattern:
1. Verify it exists in the research section
2. Confirm trust score is from APEX, not invented
3. Document where in research you found it

VIOLATION: Claiming "PAT:NEW:THING" that wasn't in research
CONSEQUENCE: apex_reflect will reject, trust scores become meaningless
</critical>

<intelligence-sources>
Check these sections for valid patterns:
- ctx.impl (reusable_snippets, project_conventions)
- ctx.patterns (pattern_cache.architecture)
- ctx.web (best_practices, official_docs)

## Architecture Review Checkpoint

I've completed the 5 mandatory artifacts. Here's the selected architecture:

**Chosen Solution**: [Winner from Tree of Thought]
**Key Patterns**: [Top 3 patterns]
**Excluded Scope**: [Top 3 YAGNI items]
**Complexity**: [X/10]
**Risk Level**: [LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH]

**Implementation will**:
1. [Key outcome 1]

**Implementation will NOT**:
- [YAGNI item 1]
