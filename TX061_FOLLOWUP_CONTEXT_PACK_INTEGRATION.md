# T061: Update Intelligence Gatherer to Include Task Data in Context Pack

## Problem Statement

The intelligence-gatherer agent (in `/Users/ben/.claude/agents/intelligence-gatherer.md`) is not using the new `ContextPackService` that was implemented in APE-55. Currently, it manually orchestrates multiple subagents but doesn't include task-specific data (active tasks, similar tasks, statistics) that the new service provides.

## Current State

**What APE-55 Implemented:**
- `ContextPackService` in `src/intelligence/context-pack-service.ts`
- Provides task data: active_tasks, recent_similar_tasks, task_statistics, task_patterns
- Has LRU caching, size budgeting, and <1.5s performance

**What's Missing:**
- Intelligence-gatherer doesn't call the ContextPackService
- Task data is not included in the context pack YAML
- The service was exposed as an MCP tool (`apex.context.pack`) but intelligence-gatherer isn't using it yet

## Solution Approach

### MCP Tool Integration (Selected Approach)
Update intelligence-gatherer to:
1. Call the `apex.context.pack` MCP tool to fetch task data
2. Merge the returned task data into the existing context pack structure
3. Include active_tasks, recent_similar_tasks, task_statistics in the YAML output

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Intelligence-gatherer includes task data in context pack
- [ ] Active tasks section populated from ContextPackService
- [ ] Similar tasks found and included for each active task
- [ ] Task statistics (completion rate, average duration) included
- [ ] Task patterns extracted and included
- [ ] Context pack remains under 30KB total
- [ ] No duplicate similar task lookups (use service's implementation)

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Update Intelligence-Gatherer Agent

Add the MCP tool to the agent's tools list:
```yaml
tools: Grep, Glob, Read, LS, Bash, Task, mcp__apex-mcp__apex_patterns_lookup, mcp__apex-mcp__apex_patterns_discover, mcp__apex-mcp__apex_patterns_explain, mcp__apex-mcp__apex_context_pack
```

Note: The actual MCP tool name is `apex.context.pack` but in the tools list it should be referenced as `mcp__apex-mcp__apex_context_pack`.

Add a direct MCP tool call after reading the task file and before the parallel subagent orchestration:
```markdown
## After reading task file:

1. First read and parse the task file
2. Then fetch task context via MCP tool:

<mcp__apex-mcp__apex_context_pack>
{
  "task_id": "[TASK_ID]",  // Optional: specific task
  "packs": ["tasks", "patterns", "statistics"],
  "max_active_tasks": 50,
  "max_similar_per_task": 20,
  "max_size_bytes": 28672
}
</mcp__apex-mcp__apex_context_pack>

3. Extract task data from the response
4. Continue with parallel subagent orchestration (but skip duplicate similar task searches)
```

### 2. Merge Task Data into Context Pack

Update the context pack structure to include:
```yaml
context_pack:
  # ... existing sections ...
  
  task_data:  # NEW SECTION
    active_tasks:
      - id: "T058"
        title: "Implement caching layer"
        phase: "BUILDER"
        intent: "Add Redis caching"
        confidence: 0.7
        files_touched: ["api/cache.ts"]
    
    recent_similar_tasks:
      T058_similar:
        - id: "T034"
          title: "Add session caching"
          outcome: "success"
          key_learning: "Redis sync operations work"
          patterns_used: ["PAT:CACHE:REDIS"]
    
    task_statistics:
      total_completed: 127
      success_rate: 0.84
      average_duration_ms: 180000
    
    task_patterns:
      by_theme:
        caching:
          common_files: ["config/redis.ts"]
          common_decisions: ["TTL strategy"]
```

### 3. Remove Redundant Operations

Since ContextPackService already:
- Finds similar tasks efficiently
- Calculates statistics
- Has LRU caching

The intelligence-gatherer should:
- Remove manual similar task searches
- Use the service's pre-computed data
- Benefit from the service's caching

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: Leverages ContextPackService's LRU cache and optimizations
2. **Consistency**: Single source of truth for task data
3. **Maintainability**: No duplicate logic between intelligence-gatherer and service
4. **Completeness**: Task context available throughout execution phases

## Notes

- The ContextPackService is already initialized in the MCP tools index
- The service handles size budgeting and truncation automatically
- Similar task search is already optimized with FTS5

## ARCHITECT → BUILDER Handoff

### Architecture Decision

Direct integration of the ContextPackService MCP tool into the intelligence-gatherer agent. The solution involves:
1. Adding the MCP tool to the agent's tools list
2. Inserting a new MCP tool call after reading the task file but before parallel orchestration
3. Updating the YAML context pack structure to include the task_data section
4. Removing the redundant "Search similar tasks" subagent (lines 207-222) since the MCP tool handles this

### Files to Create/Modify

- [x] /Users/ben/.claude/agents/intelligence-gatherer.md - Update to integrate MCP tool

### Key Specifications

**1. Add MCP tool to tools list (line 4):**
```yaml
tools: Grep, Glob, Read, LS, Bash, Task, mcp__apex-mcp__apex_patterns_lookup, mcp__apex-mcp__apex_patterns_discover, mcp__apex-mcp__apex_patterns_explain, mcp__apex-mcp__apex_context_pack
```

**2. Add MCP tool call (insert after line 146, before parallel orchestration):**
```markdown
## Task Data Collection:

After reading the task file, fetch task context data via MCP:

```markdown
<mcp__apex-mcp__apex_context_pack>
{
  "task_id": "[TASK_ID]",
  "packs": ["tasks", "patterns", "statistics"],
  "max_active_tasks": 50,
  "max_similar_per_task": 20,
  "max_size_bytes": 28672
}
</mcp__apex-mcp__apex_context_pack>
```

Extract and store the returned task data for inclusion in the final context pack.
```

**3. Update YAML structure (add after line 56, within pattern_cache section):**
```yaml
  task_data:  # NEW SECTION from MCP tool
    active_tasks: []      # From ContextPackService
    recent_similar_tasks: {}  # From ContextPackService
    task_statistics: {}   # From ContextPackService
    task_patterns: {}     # From ContextPackService
```

**4. Remove redundant subagent (delete lines 207-222):**
Remove the entire "Search similar tasks" Task block since the MCP tool now provides this data.

**5. Update aggregation logic (modify around line 251):**
- Merge MCP tool's task data into the context pack
- No longer need to aggregate similar tasks from separate subagent

### Implementation Notes

- The MCP tool name in the tools list must be: `mcp__apex-mcp__apex_context_pack`
- The actual tool call uses the same name: `<mcp__apex-mcp__apex_context_pack>`
- The task data should be inserted as a new section in the YAML structure
- Preserve all existing MCP pattern tools (they're still needed)
- The ContextPackService handles caching and optimization automatically
- Remove duplicate similar task searching to avoid redundancy
