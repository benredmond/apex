# T068: Improve Pattern Discover MCP Tool

## Problem Statement
The apex_patterns_discover MCP tool is not returning sufficiently relevant results. Pattern discovery is a critical component of the APEX intelligence system, and suboptimal results impact the effectiveness of the entire workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Analyze current apex_patterns_discover implementation and identify weaknesses
- [ ] Review search and ranking algorithms for improvements
- [ ] Implement enhanced relevance scoring based on context
- [ ] Add semantic search capabilities if not already present
- [ ] Improve pattern matching accuracy
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for discovery scenarios
- [ ] Validate improvements with real-world pattern queries

## Technical Requirements
1. Maintain backward compatibility with existing MCP tool interface
2. Optimize query performance (sub-100ms for typical queries)
3. Support fuzzy matching and synonym recognition
4. Implement context-aware ranking
5. Add metrics/logging for discovery quality monitoring

## Related Tasks
- TX052: Enhance semantic search pattern discovery (completed)
- TX061: Context pack integration work
- T065: Extract new patterns functionality

## Scope
- Review current implementation in src/mcp/tools/
- Analyze pattern storage and indexing in database
- Investigate FTS5 capabilities and usage
- Examine pattern metadata and trust scoring integration
- Test with diverse query scenarios

## Out of Scope
- Complete rewrite of pattern storage system
- Migration to external search services
- Changes to pattern format or structure
