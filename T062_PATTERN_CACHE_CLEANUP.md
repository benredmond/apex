# Follow-up: Pattern Cache Reference Cleanup and Validation

## Context
This task addresses pattern cache consistency concerns identified in T060_APE-61:
- Auto-creation fixes may have affected cache invalidation logic
- Need to ensure pattern cache consistency after validation changes
- Validate cache reference integrity across the system

## Problem Statement
After implementing validation fixes for pattern auto-creation, we need to ensure that the pattern cache system maintains consistency and properly handles cache invalidation when patterns are auto-created or modified.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Review cache invalidation logic for pattern auto-creation scenarios
- [ ] Validate cache reference consistency across all pattern operations
- [ ] Ensure cache keys remain stable after validation changes
- [ ] Test cache performance under auto-creation workloads
- [ ] Document cache invalidation strategy for pattern modifications

## Technical Approach
1. Audit current pattern cache implementation for consistency issues
2. Test cache invalidation behavior with auto-created patterns
3. Verify cache key generation remains stable
4. Check for memory leaks in cache reference handling
5. Validate cache hit/miss ratios are maintained

## Files to Review
- `src/intelligence/pattern-manager.js` - Main pattern cache logic
- `src/reflection/pattern-inserter.ts` - Pattern insertion and cache updates
- `src/mcp/tools/reflect.ts` - Auto-creation cache interaction
- Pattern cache implementation files

## Dependencies
- T060_APE-61 validation fixes must be stable
- Pattern cache system must be operational
- Auto-creation functionality must be working

## Estimated Effort
- 1 hour (complexity rating: 2/10)
- Low risk - primarily validation and cleanup work

## Success Metrics
- Cache hit ratios maintain >80% for pattern lookups
- Zero memory leaks in pattern cache references
- Cache invalidation works correctly for auto-created patterns
- All cache-related tests pass
- Cache performance remains under 5ms for lookups
